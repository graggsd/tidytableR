tidytableR
==========

The goal of tidytableR is to is to reshape the output of an analysis from a tidy format into a for suitable for presentation. It allows users to map column names from an input data frame to elements of an output table.

The package was developed from code meant to act as a wrapper script for the `htmlTable` function in the [htmlTable](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/htmlTable/index.html) package. Therfore, many of the variable names and symantics are related to those used in the `htmlTable` package.
